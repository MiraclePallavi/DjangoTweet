python -m pip install pillow
in settings ⚗️ MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')
then for sttic folder: STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')]
then in url attach:  +static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

from django.conf.urls.static import static

Then creat app in app make urls.py file and copy exact of urls.py in project add your app name in settings and also add directory so that you can keep templates in every app that you will hunt
now add urls to inform project that you have new app e.g: path('tweet/', inlcude('tweet.urls')),
